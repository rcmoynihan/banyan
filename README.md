# Banyan

**A hierarchical, self-compounding agent harness for Claude Code, built for nested subagents.**

A banyan tree's branches drop aerial roots that become new trunks — a single tree that grows into a forest. It begins life on a host tree before standing on its own, and it lives for centuries, continuously expanding. That's the project: agents whose branches become trunks (nested subagents, Claude Code ≥ 2.1.172), bootstrapped from the leaf assets of [compound-engineering-plugin](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin) (MIT), designed for harnesses that outlive any single task and get better with every run.

## Core ideas

- **Subtrees with contracts, not waves.** Lead agents (`bn-review-lead`, `bn-research-lead`, `bn-delivery-lead`) own whole domains and orchestrate their own children; the main session stays a near-empty trunk that talks to the user.
- **Fractal compounding.** Lessons are harvested at the leaves, where context is fresh, and consolidated by a background curator — compounding as metabolism, not a command you remember to run.
- **The ledger is the ground truth.** Coordination happens through files (`docs/runs/<run-id>/`); final messages are verdicts plus paths.
- **Delegation envelopes.** Every spawn carries an objective, an artifact path, boundaries, and a budget (children, model tier, remaining depth).
- **The laws still hold.** Reads parallelize, writes serialize, one writer per file set, decompose on failure rather than eagerly.

## Documents

- [Founding brainstorm](docs/brainstorms/2026-06-10-banyan-v2-brainstorm.md) — the research synthesis and full v2 ideation (verbatim export).
- [Fork vs greenfield decision](docs/decisions/2026-06-10-fork-vs-greenfield.md) — why a new skeleton that harvests v1's leaves.
- [Implementation plan](docs/plans/2026-06-10-001-feat-banyan-core-plan.md) — phased plan with implementation units U1–U16.

## Status

Pre-implementation. Phase 0 (plugin scaffold) is next; the first real milestone is the review subtree (U8) and its A/B evaluation against `/ce-code-review` (U9).
